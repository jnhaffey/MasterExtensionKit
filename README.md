# Master Extension Kit Wiki

The Master Extension Kit is an attempt to bring together a wide range of extensions that developers create and use.  Many times, developers will write an extension that another developer somewhere else has already created.  The hope of this collection is to normalize these extensions, test them by many developers, and make them available to the community so all of us can write less code.

In this Wiki, you will find a breakdown of all the extensions that are currently in the Master Extension Kit  
[Master Extension Kit Wiki](https://github.com/jnhaffey/MasterExtensionKit/wiki)

Namespaces will be added as new extensions for different types/classes are added.

Be sure to read the page [Submitting to the Collection](https://github.com/jnhaffey/MasterExtensionKit/wiki/Submitting-to-the-Collection) before actually submitting any code.

The Master Extension Kits are available as a NuGet Packages:
* [MasterExtenionKit.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MasterExtensionKit.Core/2.0.0)
